<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The mod provides three main features:<br>
- delay the transition from BG1 after Sarevok's death until the player decides to move on<br>
- provide a continuous story for the Sword of Chaos<br> 
- extend the original game character of Tamoko into a joinable NPC<br>
<br>
<br>
In the game: After you defeat Sarevok in the Undercity, you find the Sword of Chaos he was wielding and it is now yours. While you return to the surface to report your success to the Dukes, you are ambushed and the sword is taken from you. Talking to the Dukes in the Palace and reading some scrolls from fallen assassins point to remaining followers of Sarevok lead by some Korlasz.

The Dukes ask you to find and eliminate those villains which is also in your own interest. During this visit to the palace it is in addition decided that Imoen stays with Liia Jannath for some time. It is a promise the Dukes had made to Gorion and Winthrop to advance her education.

Leaving the palace, you meet Tamoko. You get a chance to let her join your party. (Unless you killed her earlier)

Whenever you decide to return to Undercity Temple, the transition to SoD will be done.

Tamoko comes with the stats and equipment of the original character. She is a neutral/evil cleric. Her dialogues will reveal a bit of the inner circle around Sarevok but she does not want to be a victim of her past anymore. Joining you may give her a third chance in her life to turn things around after two tragic failures that lie behind her.
Tamoko will stay with you during SoD until she meets her fate...
<br>
<br>
The mod tries to make the existing encounter in SoA a bit more meaningful by providing a story of how the bhaalspawn received knowledge about the building and the entry method. Throughout the game a number of existing or new encounters provide some hints to the Rune's activities and the agents working for them, many do that unknowingly.
<br>
<br>
Install order:
- If the mod is installed in BGEE/SoD, the further events in SoA and ToB are truncated; only EET provides a continuous story.
- If you use any of them, then Sarevok Romance and Unfinished Business install prior Tamoko and SandrahNPC after it. This way they recognise each others presence and provide compatibility of content.<br>
